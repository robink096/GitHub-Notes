# Random Notes
--------------
I really want to learn the markup for the editor. I also want to relearn how to do some comand line things. 
I take care of a lot of these features with dropbox

COMMAND for new project: git init project1
.git folder is where everything is saved to
COMMAND for readdressing your config file: git remote add origin https://github.com/robink096/project1

3 things needed to start:
* Command Line - git.sem.com
* GUI - mac.github.com / windows.github.com
* GitHub account

Settings in the command line can be changed on 3 levels:
* local - closest to user takes most precedient
* global - a layer further than local
* system - the outer layer overwritten by both above

Initilizing project from command line
COMMAND - git init

making a commit:
C git status // checks to see if there is something in the staging area, ready to be committed
C git add // adds a file to the staging area 
C git status // check to see if the file made it to the area
C git commit // sends the new version to the repo
C git commit -m "This is for the message" // add a msg for the edit, without it the editor forces you to 

# Vid 4 - Diff
